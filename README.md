This webpage serves as a *practical* guide to Verity. Learn it by doing it, repeatedly, with minimal guidance (but a lot less add pressure). Or, if needed (if you found this), you can read this to help get your bearings:

## Verity

The encounter takes place is a bright white room, with a projector displaying shadow-shapes on one wall, cycling between the three basic shapes of the raid (Triangle, Circle, and Square). The room has nine statues. 6 of them are at the back of the room (opposite the projector screen), and 3 of them are at the front of the room. The back six show the full fireteam (if there are less than six players in the fireteam, then some of the statue-spots will be empty). The front three show three specific guardians of the fireteam, each with a hand up and an object hovering over it. These objects are 3-dimensional shapes made of combinations of the three shapes, such that between all three statues there are two of each basic shape.

There are three *reflections* of this room. In these versions, there are three significant differences, as the encounter starts. The back half of the room is blocked off by a wall of glass; the projector now cycles between two shapes (which can be the same shape), not all three; and the front three statues are holding 2-dimensional basic shapes, one of each of the basic three.

Upon encounter start, three guardians get chosen to be copied as the statues at the front of the room, and are each sent into a different reflection (or "solo room").

In any version of the room, there are Knights, who upon death drop a Splinter, which is one of the basic shapes being projected on the wall of that version of the room. Upon being picked up, that Splinter will allow interacting with the statues at the front of the room.

In a solo room, Splinters can be Registered at other guardians' statues to *send* those Splinters to that guardian's wall, removing it from one's own. Also, if that Splinter does not match that guardian's statue's own 2D shape, then it *removes* that shape from the reciever's copy of that statue.  
In the main room, Splinters can be Dissected at statues which hold shapes that that Splinter is part of. This preps a transformation: when two Splinters are Dissected like this, then the each statue loses the shape that was Dissected from it, and gains the shape that was Dissected from the other. For example, a Cone (which is a Triangle and a Circle) got Dissected with a Triangle, and a Cylinder (which is a Circle and a Square) got Dissected with a Circle; the first shape becomes a Sphere (Circle + Circle), and the second shape becomes a Prism (Triangle + Square).

Upon killing all Knights in a batch, an Ogre spawns. Kill it to get a new batch of knights.

At one point, the three solo players get soft-killed - forced into spectate mode, with their ghosts placed in the main room at about where they were when it happened. Simultaneously, their statues disappeared from the group of six at the back of the room. Each solo guardian, while spectating guardians in the main room, can see one of the three solo guardians. The main room guardians must pick up the ghosts and put them at the *matching* statues, or get killed for their error.

### Progressing the Encounter

In order to progress, the solo guardians must break through the glass wall. There are a few requirements which all must be met:
- Their statues must only have one shadow between the three of them (their own statue).
- They must have only two shapes on their wall, one each of the shapes their own statue is *not* holding. (The challenge suggests that there is more possible variation, here)
- The other two solo guardians must also have those conditions met.
- They must be holding both splinters simultaneously.
- Finally, their statue in the main room must also be holding that particular combination of shapes.

With all of those conditions met, the solo guardians will be able to emerge through the glass wall back into the main room. After a brief add-phase, and then a 5-player en-ghost-ening (not featured in this quiz), that concludes one round of the encounter. The next round then starts, with another three guardians getting taken into solo rooms.

After doing three full rounds, the encounter is complete and you can grab your loot and keep on climbing. But, since this quiz is not going to try to do that... it'll just keep on giving you rounds of Verity.

### Strategy

Solo guardians should note the sequence of shapes of their statues in chat. Then, they should check the shadows on their walls. If none of them see two of the same shape, then they can each give both their symbols to *one* other guardian, giving them the perfect pair to escape. However, if any of them has a double of a shape, then while two of them *could* give the third guardian the right symbols, they should instead split their symbols up. This allows getting all the shapes to the right guardians in 6 total Registrations.  
- For example, if someone calls "Doubles" and you see Square and Circle on your wall, check which shape your statue is holding. In this case, lets say it was Circle. You are going to pass one shape to the Square guardian, and one shape to the Triangle guardian. Passing Square to Square does nothing of value, so you should pass Circle to Square, and Square to Triangle. This is always true, when there's a double that you don't have: **Pass the symbol that doesn't match your statue to the statue with the symbol you don't have**.
- Or, another example: Nobody has a double, and you see Square and Circle on your wall. Since both shapes are going to the same guardian, they must be going to the Triangle guardian. This is always true, when there's no doubles: **Pass your symbols to the statue which has the *other* symbol** .
- Finally, if *you* see two of the same symbol, make sure you announce "Doubles", and (after allowing your fellow guardians a moment to think through what they see) pass one copy of that symbol to each other statue. This one is easy - there's a reason it is a popular strategy to first sort the symbols, then do this, every time.

In the main room, there is no elegant solution. Merely do your best - it never needs to take more than six Dissection actions, but even if it does, you do have some time. Just keep on getting the splinters into more-correct locations and you should be okay. Keep checking and cross referencing with the callout in chat. If one statue is already correct, then you never need to Dissect it again; if two statues are correct, then the third must be as well. When the statues are correct, move back to the 6 statues, where the adds are much less threatening.

And, always, kill Unstoppable Ogres as quickly as you can. Leaving an unstop alive in order to do a thing is a good way to die without having managed to do the thing.
